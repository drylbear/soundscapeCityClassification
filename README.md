Experiments completed on data originally collected for DCASE Acoustic Scene Challenge. 


Feature extraction prepares the data (you'll need to update paths to your own).
Numbers show the order of the experiments undertaken. Model training is separate to model evaluation. Evaluation includes performance analysis.
